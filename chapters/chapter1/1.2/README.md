# 1.2 - Variables and Arithemetic Expressions

- Variables MUST be declared before they are used (usually at the beginning of a function)
  - Remember `main()` is also a function
- **Declarations** announces the properties of variables, a type name, and a list of variables

## Printing:

`printf("%d\t%d\n", fahr, celsius);`

- % signs indicate a substitution
- d indicates an integer
- %d indicates an integer to be substituted (relative to it's location)
- fahr will be first and celsius will be second

- %3d will print as decimal integer with minimum of 3
- %6d will print as decimal integer with minimum of 6
- %f prints floating point
- %6f will print float with 6 min of 6
- %.2f will print as floating point with 2 characters AFTER decimal point
- %6.2f will print as float with min of 6 AND 2 chars after decimal

## Basic Data Types:

- char - character (single byte)
- short - short integer
- long - long integer
- double - double precision floating point
